										THE SENSORS NETWORKING PROTOCOL

Summary

1. Purpose
    The Sensors Networking Protocol is used in multimedia sensors network.
It enables internal communication between sensors in the network. It is also
responsible for maintaining links : a sensor and its childs for example.

2. Overview of the Protocol
    As mentioned above, the protocol is in charge of the communication between
each network sensor.All links are up when each sensor introduce to its parent through a Hello request. 
A sensor should consider that one of its child sensor is down when it cannot communicate with this one anymore.
A request system has been established. Indeed, a sensor can retrieve the data of its children. It sends a query in which is 
specified the catch area and the quality of the data that each of its children can transmit.
A request implies an answer, also a sensor can anwser to a request.

3. Relation to other Protocols
       The data protocol run over TCP. Indeed, it needs some reliable delivery of datas.
It is not a real time protocol, such like RTP, consequently the data procotol does not need to use UDP as a transport layer.
TCP is a reliable stream delivery service that guarantees to deliver a stream of data sent from one host to another
without duplication or data loss.

4. Initial Networking Sensors
   At first, a sensor tries to communicate with its parent through the port 31001. It sends a HELLO REQUEST to announce
its self. This packet is sent while the parent has not anwsered.

5. Sensors Protocol Packets
   
The protocol support 4 types of packets, all of them have been mentioned
above :
  
1 HELLO REQUEST
2 HELLO REPLY
3 INFOS
4 REQDATA
5 REPDATA
6 ACK

5.1. Set up links
5.1.1. Child discovery
When a sensor starts, it tries to contact its parent sensor with a HELLO REQUEST packet. The parent sensor is set by the initial configuration or by a configuration packet. If the parent sensor of the current one is not null (it is the case just for the root sensor), the current sensor send a HELLO REQUEST packet until the parent sensor replies with an HELLO REPLY packet. With this, the child sensor is certified that its parent is up.
If the parent sensor of the sensor changes during it's up, the sensor sends a new HELLO REQUEST packet to its new parent to maintain the network topology.

idS : id of the current (source) node.
idD : id of the parent (destination) node.

5.1.2. Parent answer
When a sensor node receive a HELLO REQUEST packet on the default port, it adds the source sensor to the list of its childs. These children will be used for the data requests later. The sensor have to reply to its new children with a HELLO REPLY packet setting up the error code to null.

5.2. Share sensor's parameters

Each sensor has to share its parameters with its parent. These parameters are sent in an INFOS packet after an HELLO REQUEST packet and every second. With this, a parent sensor will be able to merge its own informations with all informations from its children. By recursion, the root sensor (or sink) will be able to know the global informations for the complete network. These informations are updated each time an INFOS packet is re-sent. This protocol enables to answer quickly to a request without asking all sensors to know if this request can be released.
If a sensor has no parent (root sensor), this packet is not transmitted.

5.3. Handle data requests

The only sensor which can receive user requests is the root sensor. This sensor is the only one which can give the final answer to this request too. When any sensor receive a data request in a REQDATA packet, it tries to get the maximum datas corresponding to this request. The data request is divided as following :

										             4 bytes     8 bytes    
										            -----------------------
										           | Opcode |  Catch area  |
										            -----------------------

												   Figure 5-2: REQDATA packet

- Catch area : the catch area requested.
- Data : the oldest modification date requested for this area.

The root sensor knows if a request can be released or not. Indeed, it stores informations about its children :  catch area, quality etc.
So, it can decide which child is able to transmit the data corresponding to the request. In fact, all sensors which have children stores
informations about them. It avoids to request all the sensors and overflow the network.


A request involves an answer. Basically, a parent sensor can receive the answers of its children. If the answers are relevant, it has to merge them. Then, it forwards to its own parent.
Such a reply packet is described below :

								             4 bytes     8 bytes     4 bytres  n bytes
								            -------------------------------------------
								           | Opcode |  catch area  |  quality | data   |
								             ------------------------------------------

Finally, the root sensor can answer to the original request with a positive or negative packet.
